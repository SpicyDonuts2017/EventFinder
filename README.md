# EventFinder
EventFinder is the place to go when you want to find all upcoming events near you.

# Summary
EventFinder is a web app that provides a visual representation of upcoming events based on location. A user can input a location into the search field and see geographically where an event will be in the next week. Clicking a marker on the map will reveal details about the event and a link to purchase tickets.

# Problem
If you want to go to an event near you, but do not have a specific artist or venue in mind, there is no visual way to see upcoming events other than reading through a long list of events or inputting very refined search filters.

# Solution
EventFinder allows a user to input their location, and see a map of all events coming up nearby. This makes it easy to see all events nearby and how far away the venue.
